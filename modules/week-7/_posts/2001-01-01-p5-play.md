# Overview

Here is the definition on their site

p5.play is a p5.js library for the creation of games and playthings.

p5.play provides a Sprite class to manage visual objects in 2D space and features such as animation support, basic collision detection and resolution, sprite grouping, helpers for mouse and keyboard interactions, and a virtual camera.

p5.play extends p5.js, a javascript library (and a community) that aims to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners. If you are not familiar with p5.js, you should start here.

p5.play is built for accessibility and simplicity, not performance. It is designed to be understood and possibly modified by intermediate programmers.
