# Health

<div class="tab">
  <button class="tablinks active" onclick="openTab(event, 'Overview')">Overview</button>
  <button class="tablinks" onclick="openTab(event, 'health')">health</button>
</div>

<div id="Overview" class="tabcontent" style="display:block"  >
<div class="tabhtml" markdown="1">

Because, the rock is destroyed too quickly and so the x and y are no longer there. How do we fix this problem? We will give the rock a health component.

<div id="health" class="tabcontent">
<div class="tabhtml" markdown="1">

First, let's create a health variable.

```js
var health = 100;
```

Then, in the collision area, let's reduce the health by one.  Once, the health hits zero, then we will destroy the rock.

```js
else if(keyDown('x'))
    {
      cowGirlObjects.changeAnimation('attack');
     
      if(rock != null)
      {
        if(dist(cowGirlObjects.position.x,cowGirlObjects.position.y,rock.position.x,rock.position.y) < 250)
        {
          createParticles(rock.position.x, rock.position.y);
          health -= 1;
          if(health <= 0)
          {
            rock.remove();
            rock = null;
          }
       
        }
      }
```

As you can see the `createParticles` function is called at the rock's x and y coordinate until the health reaches zero and then the rock is removed an the createParticles function is no longer called.
