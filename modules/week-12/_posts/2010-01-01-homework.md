In this homework, you are going to experiment and create a game. Your main objective is to avoid the obstacles while attempting to collect all the collectables before you run out of health.
1.	Add a background. Itâ€™s up to you what you put on there.
2.	If you are hit, you should lose health. If you run out of health, the game should be over.
3.	You should also have collectibles. You are to create at least five obstacles and they should either chase or patrol. Your choice!
4.	There should be at least 5 collectibles as well.
5.	If you collect everything, you should win.
6. Because of the size of your project, you will most likely need to upload everything into Box and submit a Box link this week.
