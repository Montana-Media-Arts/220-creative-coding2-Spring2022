# Asset Store 

One of the things of which I want you to be aware of is Unity's Asset store.  There are many free and paid assets that you can use in your project.  The one we will use is the Unity Playground.

1. Go to **Window** -> **Asset Store**. 
2. Click on the **Search online** button.
3. Enter your login credentials if you haven't already.
4. In the **Search for assets**, type **Unity Playground**.
5. Click on the **Unity Playground**.
6. Click on **Download**.
7. After the download completes, click on **Import**.
8. In the **Import Unity Package** dialog window, click **Import**.
9. The importing process adds several different folders to the **Project** tab.
