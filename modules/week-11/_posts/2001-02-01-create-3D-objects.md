How do we create 3D objects? There are several tools to help us and it's important to know what we need to create in order to import them into p5.js.

With any of these tools, you will want to create a STL or OBJ file so that it can be imported correctly.

#### What is STL?

What does “STL” mean? The most common explanation is to say that it is the abbreviation of the word Stereolithography, given by 3D Systems. But others will tell that it is actually referring to Standard Triangle Language or even Standard Tessellation Language. No one really knows, but the most important thing is not the origin of the name STL, it is what it does.

An STL file stores information about your 3D model. The format represents the raw surface of a model with small triangles. The more complex and detailed the structure is, the more triangles will be used to represent the model.

#### What is OBJ?

An OBJ file is a standard 3D image format that can be exported and opened by various 3D image editing programs. It contains a three-dimensional object, which includes 3D coordinates, texture maps, polygonal faces, and other object information. OBJ files may also store references to one or more .MTL files that contain surface shading material for the object.

The OBJ format is considered to be a universal 3D model format since it is widely supported by 3D image editing applications. The format is simple and text-based, which is one reason why many programs use it. However, the simple format structure may also lead to huge OBJ file sizes if they store large and complex 3D objects.

You may encounter an OBJ file in a variety of ways, such as when modifying 3D objects in a video game, creating visual effects for a film, or designing a 3D mockup of a real-life object or building. Since the OBJ 3D format is so widely supported, many users export their models as OBJ files when transferring them from one 3D program to another or when sharing a 3D model with a co-worker.
