# Homework

In this assignment, you are going to create another art piece! I would like you to create a 3D model(s) (or find one), import it and display it.  Then, create some textured 3D objects. This time, you should have your model as the focal point and then have all the other object rotate around them at different speeds.  Then, you should have some mouse events that change the location of at least 2 objects. Please make sure your name is on your piece and give it a title.
