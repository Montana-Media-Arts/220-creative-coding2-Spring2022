## Overview of the Course

This class is designed to build upon what you learned in Creative Coding 1 and give you a new perspective on writing code along with interactive pieces.  This course focuses on reinforcing programming concepts using Processing, Arduino and 3D Printing, Game Development and Augment Reality.  There will be hands-on opportunities so that you can become proficient in using these tools.

* General Computing Concepts
* Logical Reasoning and Critical Thinking
* Multiple programming paradigms



<!-- The final topic will touch on the power of JS and node.js for server-side development. A number of JavaScript libraries will be explored for how they can speed up the artistic process. -->

## Objectives

Upon completing this course, a student will be able to: 


* Understand programming concepts and build visually interactive programs using p5.js
* Interact with online Arduino boards
* Interact and build 3D models and art pieces
* Use existing game engines to build a simple game
* Work with Augment Reality tools



<!-- - Have a basic understanding of the role node.js plays in web development. -->
<!-- - Be capable of creating a basic web-socket based web-app for multi-user interaction. -->

## What to Expect

This course will force you to learn and adapt to new technologies, while also thinking about design, and content creation. Some weeks will lean more technical in nature, while others will lean more creative-based.

Just as the content focus will shift, so to will the work amount. Some weeks, especially those when new topics are being introduced, have a heavier workload. The goal of this is to make you practice with these new technologies and techniques. Other weeks will slow down and allow you to practice at a more exploratory pace.

You should plan;

- 3 hours a week to work through the course website content (what you are doing now).
- 3-9 hours a week to work on concepts, code assignments, studying, and practicing.

## Class Goals

There are 4 high-level goals for this course;

1. Learn how to problem solve. (More specifically, how to break a problem down into sub-problems that are easier to solve by themselves)
2. Adapt to constantly changing technological paradigms by learning how to learn. (Skills acquisition.)
3. Combine technical and artistic practices through inquiry and iteration.
4. Adopt and use professional practices.
