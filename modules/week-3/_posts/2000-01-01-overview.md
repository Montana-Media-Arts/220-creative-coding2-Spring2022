For this week, we will continue with some more techinques in p5.js.  We will look specifically at how to set up our directories, how to add images, add some motion, utilize timers, call back functions and change the fonts of our text.

Most of you will already have taken [MART120 - Creative Coding 1](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/120_CreativeCoding1-Fall2020/). For those of you who have taken 120, this will be a review for you.

For everyone, I again would encourage you to consider developing a study group that you can meet with once a week. If you get in the habit now of meeting with these people, when the content gets difficult later this semester, you will have a group with whom to work. Please feel free to use the issues-forum, discord, etc. to arrange groups if you are so inclined.  Of course, you can always contact me too!
