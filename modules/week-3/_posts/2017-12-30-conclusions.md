# Weekly Conclusions

This week, we talked about integrating external assets and connecting our sketches to other files.  We also looked at changing the fonts that appear as well as added motion to our shapes. 

## Next Week

We plan to talk about classes, objects and arrays.  Hold on to your hats! It's going to be fun.
