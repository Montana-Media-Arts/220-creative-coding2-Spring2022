# Homework

In this homework, you are going to create a new version of your artwork. This time, you should move your shapes and have them bounce off the walls and add images to your piece.  You should use the timer function to show a simple counter (change each second). Every 5 seconds, change the speed of the moving objects.   Use a new font for the title and your name.
