# Fonts

So, how do we change the fonts that are used and displayed in p5.js?

First, the font must be in the assets folder and then we can load the font just like we did with an image.  Below is an example.

```js

let myFont;
function preload() {
  myFont = loadFont('assets/inconsolata.otf');
}

function setup() {
  fill('#ED225D');
  textFont(myFont);
  textSize(36);
  text('p5*js', 10, 50);
}

```

Any open font can be loaded (.otf, .ttf).

Here is the official description from <a href="p5js.org/reference" target="_new">p5.js reference</a>.

Loads an opentype font file (.otf, .ttf) from a file or a URL, and returns a PFont Object. This method is asynchronous, meaning it may not finish before the next line in your sketch is executed.

The path to the font should be relative to the HTML file that links in your sketch. Loading fonts from a URL or other remote location may be blocked due to your browser's built-in security.
