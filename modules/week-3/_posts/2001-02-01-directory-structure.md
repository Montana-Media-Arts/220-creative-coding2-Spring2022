# Directory Structure

It's good to think about how to set up our directory structure to make sure we keep all our files organized.  At first, it's okay to have just our html file and our .js file. However, as we add more files, it's good to organize them and know how to access them.

## Assets folder

In p5.js, there is a special folder where we store all our external files. It's called the **assets** folder.  It is automatically accessed when the sketch looks for the file.

Below is an example of what the directory structure could look like.

```
HW-3
├── assets/
│   ├── picture.jpg
│   ├── picture2.jpg
│   └── picture3.jpg
├── index.html
└── sketch.js
└── p5.min.js
```

So, how does one access a file that is in the assets folder?  Go to the next section to find out.
