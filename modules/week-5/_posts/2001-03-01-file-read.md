# Reading Files
<div class="tab">
  <button class="tablinks active" onclick="openTab(event, 'Overview')">Overview</button>
  <button class="tablinks" onclick="openTab(event, 'fileread')">file read</button>
    <button class="tablinks" onclick="openTab(event, 'ToDo')">To Do</button>
 
</div>

<div id="Overview" class="tabcontent" style="display:block"  >

Okay so far, we have just been creating objects directly and adding them to an array. That is fine, but in the world, we will want to use some sort of data source when running our programs.  This will allow us to scale our programs or change what we want to display without having to change our code.

So, what does basic file reading look like?

</div>
</div>
<div id="fileread" class="tabcontent">
<div class="tabhtml" markdown="1">

So, like reading in images, files are the same way.  We are going to use a function called loadStrings to read in our files.  Here is a simple example (assuming that you have a file in your assets folder).

```js
var result;
var y  = 10;
function preload() {
  result = loadStrings('assets/info.txt');
}

function setup() {
  background(200);
  for(var i = 0; i < result.length; i++)
  {
    text(result[i], 10, y, 80, 80);
  }
  
  // move the next line down by 20 pixels
  y+=20;
}
```

This will display the text that is stored in the file.  So, how do we make it useful for us?

Try the code in the earlier tabs to see the final result. Feel free to change values.
