# Homework

In this homework, you are going to create the first part of your experience. Based on what we have done so far, you should be able to display two different animations in the idle state. Both animations should be stored in an array. Now, you should have a third array with just static images. 

At this point, the first animation should move and change based on the arrow keys or the WASD keys.  Now, we want to make sure the appropriate animation appears.  Hence, you want make sure the character move with the correct orientation.

You need a separate (or if you want to use the same class) class for all three different animation/objects. You have freedom with how you want to approach this part.

It should have the following properties:
1. Use the imageClass to create 4 animation arrays and one static image array of obstacles.
2. Everything should be read in from a file and put into an array.
3. Randomly place the static objects on the screen
4. All items should be images and not simple shapes.
5. The character (animation) should move and orient correctly when the movement keys are pressed.
