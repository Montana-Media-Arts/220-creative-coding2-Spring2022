# Homework

In this homework, you are going to create the first part of your experience. Based on what we have done so far, you should be able to display two different animations. Both animations should be stored in an array. Now, you should have a third array with just static images or simple shapes. 

At this point, the first animation should move with input or automonously.  Now, we want to make sure the appropriate animation appears.

You need a separate (or if you want to use the same class) class for all three different animation/objects. You have freedom with how you want to approach this part.

It should have the following properties:
1. Use the imageClass to create animation arrays and static image arrays.
2. Everything should be read in from a file and put into an array.
3. Randomly place the static objects on the screen
4. One or more animations should move when the movement keys are pressed or autonomously.
