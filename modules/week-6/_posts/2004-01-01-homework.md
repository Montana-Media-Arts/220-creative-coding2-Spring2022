# Homework

In this homework, you are going to use the p5.play library and apply it to your semester project.  It may be that you have to recreate your project(don't delete your old one!) If using the keyboard the player should move in the appropriate direction and change animations depending on what key is pressed.  You should also print out your static objects randomly.  This time, you should prevent your player from walking through the objects (i.e.collisions).  If these items do not apply to your project, then extend your project and provide justification.
