# Events

<div class="tab">
  <button class="tablinks active" onclick="openTab(event, 'Overview')">Overview</button>
  <button class="tablinks" onclick="openTab(event, 'keyboard')">keyboard events</button>
  <button class="tablinks" onclick="openTab(event, 'mouse')">mouse events</button>
  <button class="tablinks" onclick="openTab(event, 'ToDo')">To Do</button>

There are two main events that we want to concern ourselves with; the keyboard events and the mouse events.  These events allow our uses to interact with our experiences which make them richer.

<div id="keyboard" class="tabcontent" >
<div class="tabhtml" markdown="1">

So, there are a couple of ways to interact using the keyboard. We can access each individual key using if statements in the draw or we can use the keyPress or keyDown events.

Let's look at examples:

```js
var x = 100;
var y = 100;

function setup() {
    createCanvas(800,600);
}

function draw() {
  background(200);
  fill(120,24,30);
  square(x,y,25);
  if(keyIsPressed)
  {
    if(key == 'a')
    {
        x-=5;
    }

    else if(key == 'd')
    {
        x+=5;
    }
    else if(key == 'w')
    {
        y-=5;
    }
    else if(key == 's')
    {
        y+=5;
    }
  }
}
```

You notice that when you click on a key and hold it, the shape continues to move. It stops as soon as the key is released. This is due to the keyIsPressed variable.  

What about the function **keyPressed**?

```js
var x = 100;
var y = 100;

function setup() {
    createCanvas(800,600);
}

function draw() {
  background(200);
  fill(120,24,30);
  square(x,y,25);
 
}
function keyPressed() {
   if(key == 'a')
    {
        x-=5;
    }
    else if(key == 'd')
    {
        x+=5;
    }
    else if(key == 'w')
    {
        y-=5;
    }
    else if(key == 's')
    {
        y+=5;
    }
}
```

When you run this program, you will see that the square still moves, but only when you click on the key and then release.  You can no longer hold the key down and move the shape.  So, this is just something of which to be aware.

<div id="mouse" class="tabcontent" >
<div class="tabhtml" markdown="1">

What about mouse events.  There are many events that are recognized in p5.js such as mouseMoved, mouseClicked, doubleClicked, and more.  We will look specifically at the **mouseMoved** and **mouseClicked** and apply it to our example.  I encourage you to try out the others.

Let's start with an example with mouseMoved.

```js
var x = 100;
var y = 100;

function setup() {
    createCanvas(800,600);
}

function draw() {
  background(200);
  fill(120,24,30);
  square(x,y,25);
 
}
function mouseMoved() {
   x = mouseX;
   y = mouseY;
}
```

We are using the mouse coordinated to change the position of our square now.  The **mouseX** and the **mouseY** variables are built into p5.js and return the current location of the mouse.  

With mouseClicked, we can do the same thing except that the square will only move to the coordinates when the mouse is clicked.

```js
var x = 100;
var y = 100;

function setup() {
    createCanvas(800,600);
}

function draw() {
  background(200);
  fill(120,24,30);
  square(x,y,25);
 
}
function mouseClicked() {
   x = mouseX;
   y = mouseY;
}
```

Try the code in the earlier tabs to see the final result. Feel free to change values.
