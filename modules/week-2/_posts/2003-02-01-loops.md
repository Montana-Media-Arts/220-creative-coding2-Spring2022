Loops are programming structures that allow us to perform actions multiple times without having to duplicate code.  This will come in handy if we want to display multiple items on the screen or fill an array (which we will cover again later)

There are several looping structures, but the two most common are the **for** loop and the **while** loop.

<div id="for" class="tabcontent" >
<div class="tabhtml" markdown="1">

The for loop has a specific syntax that is worth looking at. It looks some like this:

```js
    for(var i = 0; i < 5; i++)
```

So, how do we break it down?  The first keyword is **for**.  Then, comes the **(** which opens the statement.  The **var i = 0** initiates the i variable and sets the value to 0.  The second section after the first **;** is the conditional.  This is where we compare i and see if the for loop should continue. In this case, we look to see if **i < 5**.  If it is, then the body of the for loop will execute.  Then, after the body is run, then i should increment and then the comparison happens again.

What does an actual example look like?

```js
    var redColor = 0;
    var x = 100;
    var y = 100;
    var side = 50;
    function setup()
    {
        createCanvas(800,600);
        fill(redColor,100,29);
        for(var i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        {
            rect(x,y,side);
            x+=50;
            y+=50;
        }
        
    }
    function draw()
    {
    }

```

<div id="while" class="tabcontent" >
<div class="tabhtml" markdown="1">

With **while** loops, they are useful in different ways.  They don't have as many sections as **for** loops and their structure is like **if** statements. while loops continue until the condition is false. 

This is what is looks like:

```js
    while(i < 5)
```

The prior statement checks to see if **i** is less than 5.  If it is, then the body of the while loop executes.  If it is equal to or greater than 5, then the body of the while loop doesn't execute.   

What does an example look like:

```js
    var redColor = 0;
    var x = 100;
    var y = 100;
    var side = 50;
    function setup()
    {
        createCanvas(800,600);
        fill(redColor,100,29);
        var i = 0;
        while(i < 5)
        {
            rect(x,y,side);
            x+=50;
            y+=50;
            i++;
        }
        
    }
    function draw()
    {
    }

```
