# Homework

In this assignment, you are going to continue working with basic shapes in p5.js.  We are going to now formally incorporate control statements and variables. Whenever the program calls the draw method, keep track of the count. Every time the number exceeds a multiple of 1000, have your program change shapes and color. Put the shapes in random locations.

It should have the following properties:

1.	Keep the border around the edge of your window.
2.	You should use random to move your shapes into different locations within your border.
3.	You should move shapes whenever the counter is greater than a multiple 1000.
4.	Whenever the shapes move, they should also change shape type and color.
5.	Use if statements.
