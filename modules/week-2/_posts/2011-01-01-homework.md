# Homework

In this assignment, you are going to create the first iteration of a potentially interactive (focus on keyboard or mouse for now) representation of what you are creating for the video wall.  Use basic shapes to make it appear.  Feel free to continue using basic shapes at this point.  They can be placeholders for the real images.  Make sure there is some basic movement as well.

Feel free to include any cultural representation into you project as well.

<!--
continue working with basic shapes in p5.js.  We are going to now formally incorporate control statements and variables. Whenever the program calls the draw method, keep track of the count. Every time the number exceeds a multiple of 1000, have your program change shapes and color. Put the shapes in random locations.

It should have the following properties:

1. Use basic shapes of varying sizes
2. The shapes should be different colors.
3. Your name should be in the lower right-hand corner
4. You should name your piece and have it on the upper-left hand corner.
5. Have a button to go back.
6. Some of the shapes should move randomly different locations.
7. Use if statements.

<!--
1. Border around the edge of your window
2. Use at least 10 different shapes of varying sizes
3.	The border should be one solid color
4.	The shapes inside the frame should be different colors.
5.	Your name should be in the lower right-hand corner
6.	You should name your piece and have it on the upper-left hand corner.
1.	Keep the border around the edge of your window.
2.	You should use random to move your shapes into different locations within your border.
3.	You should move shapes whenever the counter is greater than a multiple 1000.
4.	Whenever the shapes move, they should also change shape type and color.
5.	Use if statements.
