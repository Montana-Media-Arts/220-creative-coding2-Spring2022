# Comments

<div class="tab">

  <button class="tablinks" onclick="openTab(event, 'single')">single-line</button>
  <button class="tablinks" onclick="openTab(event, 'multi')">multi-line</button>

Something that was added earlier, but not specifically pointed out were the use of comments.  Remember there are two different types of comments, single-line comments and multi-line comments.

We need comments to help us remember what we were thinking when we wrote our code and to help others if they were to take our code and want to work with it.  Think of it as notes to help out one another.

<div id="single" class="tabcontent" >
<div class="tabhtml" markdown="1">
Single line comments exist on only one line and look like this:

```js
    // this is a single-line comment
```

They are useful when we want create a brief note about a variable or a short section of code.  Just keep in mind that once you leave this line, the comment no longer exists.

Here is an example from one of our previous examples:

```js
    var redColor = 0;
    var x = 100;
    var y = 100;
    var side = 50;
    function setup()
    {
        createCanvas(800,600);
    }
    function draw()
    {
        background(0);
        fill(redColor,100,29);
        rect(x,y,side);
        redColor++;
        // reset the red section of the rgb
        if(redColor > 255)
        {
            redColor = 0;
        }
   
    }

```

Notice the single-line comment always begins with the `//`.

<div id="multi" class="tabcontent" >
<div class="tabhtml" markdown="1">
With multi-line comments, we can be a little more verbose without having to add new forward slashes for each line.  They are most useful when we want to talk about a function or a whole page.

In it's most basic form, the multi-line comment looks like this.

```js
    /*
        This is a multi-line comment
        we can keep writing until we
        close the comment
    */
```

For example, it might look something like this:

```js
    var redColor = 0;
    var x = 100;
    var y = 100;
    var side = 50;
    
    /*
    This is one of the main functions in p5.js
    The setup function is called only once
    and is used to initialize variables and create
    the canvas in the browser
    */
    function setup()
    {
        createCanvas(800,600);
    }
    function draw()
    {
        background(0);
        fill(redColor,100,29);
        rect(x,y,side);
        redColor++;
        // reset the red section of the rgb
        if(redColor > 255)
        {
            redColor = 0;
        }
   
    }

```

Notice, the multi-line comment always starts with `/*` and then ends with the `*/`.
