In this assignment, you are going to implement a video wall or multiple segments of your videos into p5js sketch and see how it looks in the browser.

1. Make sure you have a local copy of p5.js
2. Make sure you have a set of videos created, edited, and ready for integration.
3. Create an assets folder and add your videos.
4. Create a class to hold all the video information.
5. When creating the video objects, read in the information about the videos, position and size from a file.
6. Add a title and your name to your video wall.
7. Double-check that your videos play by opening your .html file with Live Server.
8. Upload everything to your GitHub repository.
9. Submit your GitHub link to Moodle.

Here is my example video .  I thought it would be interesting and therapeutic to film where I walk my dog every day.  I wanted to tell the story of how our town feels empty with the parks closed and the streets abandoned.
