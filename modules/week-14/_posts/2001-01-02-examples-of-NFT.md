The NFT world is relatively new. In theory, the scope for NFTs is anything that is unique that needs provable ownership. Here are some examples of NFTs that exist today, to help you get the idea:

* A unique digital artwork.
* A unique sneaker in a limited-run fashion line.
* An in-game item.
* An essay.
* A digital collectible.
* A domain name.
* A ticket that gives you access to an event or a coupon.

**NFTs have some special properties:**

* Each token minted has a unique identifier.
* They're not directly interchangeable with other tokens 1:1. For example 1 ETH is exactly the same as another ETH. This isn't the case with NFTs.
* Each token has an owner and this information is easily verifiable.
* They live on Ethereum and can be bought and sold on any Ethereum-based NFT market.

**In other words, if you own an NFT:**

* You can easily prove you own it.
* No one can manipulate it in any way.
* You can sell it, and in some cases this will earn the original creator resale royalties.
* Or, you can hold it forever, resting comfortably knowing your asset is secured by your wallet on Ethereum.

**And if you create an NFT:**

* You can easily prove you're the creator.
* You determine the scarcity.
* You can earn royalties every time it's sold.
* You can sell it on any NFT market or peer-to-peer. You're not locked in to any platform and you don't need anyone to intermediate.

**Scarcity**

The creator of an NFT gets to decide the scarcity of their asset.

For example, consider a ticket to a sporting event. Just as an organizer of an event can choose how many tickets to sell, the creator of an NFT can decide how many replicas exist. Sometimes these are exact replicas, such as 5000 General Admission tickets. Sometimes several are minted that are very similar, but each slightly different, such as a ticket with an assigned seat. In another case, the creator may want to create an NFT where only one is minted as a special rare collectible.

In these cases, each NFT would still have a unique identifier (like a bar code on a traditional "ticket"), with only one owner. The intended scarcity of the NFT matters, and is up to the creator. A creator may intend to make each NFT completely unique to create scarcity, or have reasons to produce several thousand replicas. Remember, this information is all public.

<div id="royalties" class="tabcontent">

**Royalties**

Some NFTs will automatically pay out royalties to their creators when they're sold. This is still a developing concept but it's one of the most powerful. Original owners of `EulerBeats Originals` earn an 8% royalty every time the NFT is sold on. And some platforms, like `Foundation` and `Zora`, support royalties for their artists.

This is completely automatic so creators can just sit back and earn royalties as their work is sold from person to person. At the moment, figuring out royalties is very manual and lacks accuracy â€“ a lot of creators don't get paid what they deserve. If your NFT has a royalty programmed into it, you'll never miss out.
