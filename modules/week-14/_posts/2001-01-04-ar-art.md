# Add to your Art

## Artist Statements

One of the best parts of creating art looking for new mediums.  With AR, we can draw still art and then create a new type of user experience.  The first thing we need to do is write about what motivate us to create art.  What do you want to express with your art?

## AR and Art

We are going to use Artivive.

First, go to <a href="https://artivive.com/" target="_blank">Artitive.com</a>, sign up for an account.  Create a piece of art work.  Then, create a .MP4.  Upload both and save the experience.

Download the one of the two applications:
