# TinkerCad

TinkerCad is a part of AutoDesk, which is a powerful piece of software the engineers and designers have used for many years.  It has now released a version of its software that much more user friendly and easier for students and hobbyists alike.  There are three parts to this software in which I would like to investigate. 

* Circuits
* Code Blocks 
* 3D Designs

First, you are going to join our class. I thought it would be more fun if we did this as a class.
