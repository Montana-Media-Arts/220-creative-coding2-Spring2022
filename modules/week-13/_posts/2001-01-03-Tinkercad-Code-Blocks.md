# Code Blocks

TinkerCad also gives us the ability to use code to build 3D shapes and creations.  We are going to explore those as well. 

First, go to the following link.

* <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/dashboard?type=codeblocks&collection=designs" target="_new">TinkerCad Code Blocks</a>

Then, click on **Create New Code Block**.  When the dialog box appears, click on **Intro to Shapes** activities.

Go through the activity so that you know how to code blocks add 3D shapes.

Then, go through the **Moving Shapes** tutorial and then finally, the **Rotating Shapes** tutorial.

For your portion, click on **New Design** and create something that introduces new shapes, and have them do something like move around and rotate.  You can use one of the starter designs or create your own.  Try something fun.

Don't worry; it will automatically save.
