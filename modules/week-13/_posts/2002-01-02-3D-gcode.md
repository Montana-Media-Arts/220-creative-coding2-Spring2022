# 3D Geocode

**What is 3D G-Code?**

After you create a 3D model, the printer requires a converted file so that it knows how to print the model correctly.  As such, it requires the stl file to be tranformed to g-code.  GCode is fundamentally a set of longitude and latitude coordinates that the printer uses to print the model from the bottom up.  It's pretty ingenious.

For more information, go to this website, and it will give you more information. <a href="https://all3dp.com/2/stl-to-g-code-how-to-convert-stl-files-to-g-code/" target="_new">all3dp.com</a>

One of the most common slicers is <a href="https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura" target="_new">Cura</a>.  I recommend downloading it (it's free) and then importing your STL file.

Then, after it appears, click on **Slice**, and it will create a new file for you with the extension gcode.

Save the file.  Then, right-click and open it in **VS Code** or **Atom**.

What do you see?  Is it a lot of numbers?  However, for the printer, it makes a lot of sense. It prints the bottom first and then builds on top of each layer.
