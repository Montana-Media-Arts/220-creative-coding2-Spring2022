This week is all about Augment Reality.  I want you to create a couple of experiences and talk about how it went for you. I would like you to take at least two of the tools we discussed and create something.  It's up to you how you want to do it, but I want you to be creative.  Again, we will share your experiences with the class.

1. Use at least 3 AR technologies to create AR experiences.
2. Either record the experience on the phone or do a screen capture.
3. Write a short (1/2 page) paper on how you think AR could be useful in the future.
