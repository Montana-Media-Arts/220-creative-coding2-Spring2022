# Homework

In this assignment, you are going to create some more art within your piece! This time you are going to experiment with the 3D shapes and see what you can create. There aren't too many requirements with the exception that I would like to have you add at least 5 shapes on the canvas using at least 3 different primitive shapes and then have them rotate around 1 or more axis.
