# Homework

In this assignment, you are going to create some more art! This time you are going to experiment with the 3D shapes and see what you can create. There aren't too many requirements with the exception that I would like to have you add at least 5 shapes on the canvas using at least 3 different primitive shapes and then have them rotate around 1 or more axis.  With one shape, I would like it to be interactive so you can make it move using the keys WASD and have it grow/shrink using the left and right arrow keys.

4. All shapes should rotate around 1 or more axis (x,y,z)
5. One shape should move up, down, left and right using the WASD keys
6. The same shape should grow when the right arrow key is pressed and shrink when the left arrow key is pressed.
