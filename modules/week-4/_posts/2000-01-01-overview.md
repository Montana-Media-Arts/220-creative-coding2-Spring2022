This week will continue our journey with p5.js and look more closely at Object-Oriented Programming (Classes and Objects), Arrays and Animations.

Object-Oriented Programming is something that mirrors the real world. My hope is that after this, you will see classes and objects everywhere.  

We should be able to answer these questions:

- What is a Class?
- What is an Object?
- What is an Array?
- Why do we use Classes and Objects?
- Why do we use Arrays?
- How can we use Arrays to create Animations?
