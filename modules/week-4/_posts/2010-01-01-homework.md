# Homework

In this homework, you are going to move an animated character.  If you can, relate it to your project.  Create a class of the objects in your project (simple shapes, images, properties, functions) The character should move when either WASD or the arrow keys are pressed (your choice) or independently.  When the character moves, it should go from an idle state to a moving state.
