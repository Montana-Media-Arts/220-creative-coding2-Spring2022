# Overview


## Create more Art    

This week we are going to create art and a movie in a different way using p5.  We are going talk about NFTs and what that means.  We will create an image by changing each individual pixel in the image while we draw it to the screen.  

Then, we will create the frames of movie in code. With p5, each time the draw function is called, a new frame is generated. If we save those frames, we can create a images that we can stitch together for our movie.
