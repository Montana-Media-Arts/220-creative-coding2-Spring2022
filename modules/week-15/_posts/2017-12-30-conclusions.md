# Conclusions

So this is the end of the formal part of this class.  After this, you are working solely on your final projects. You can choose from any of the technologies that we used this semester and create a game, a piece of art, or any other segement that speaks to you.  Next, week there is no formal material to look at, but hopefully it will give you plenty of time work on it. Great to have you in class!
