# Homework

This week is all about creating something new and interesting from using createImage and saveImages (maybe even an NFT).  I want you to create at least one sketch using createImage and another sketch that generates the images for movie usage using saveFrames.

1. Create one sketch using createImage. You can decide how you want to work with the pixels to generate a piece of art.
2. Make sure you create a border around the piece.
3. Add your initials using block letters.
4. Create a second sketch and use createFrames.
5. Take the images stored and put them in your assets folder.  Using what you know from earlier in the semester, and create an animation from the saved images
6. Upload all your files to GitHub and submit your link into Moodle.
